Document Summary\n==================================================\n\nThe StudyBuddy project is a RAG-based learning assistant that allows students to upload study materials and ask questions based on those materials. The project must be completed in 3 days and includes objectives such as document ingestion, embeddings generation, vector database storage, retrieval system, context-grounded QA, document summarization, and flashcard generation. Technical requirements include using Python 3.10+, recommended libraries, and OpenAI for LLM. Required features include document upload and ingestion, embeddings and vector storage, retrieval and question answering, document summary, and flashcard generation. Optional features for full marks include citations, Streamlit UI, file filters, and export summaries. The project structure must be clean and modular, with a timeline for backend core, RAG and features, and UI and documentation. Deliverables include a GitHub repository, working application, requirements.txt, README.md, PROJECT.md, reflection document, and demo. Acceptance criteria include basic completion, code quality, and bonus features. Quality expectations include no unnecessary duplication, clear variable names, proper error handling, and clear commit history. Risks and constraints include testing retrieval before LLM integration, tuning chunk size, ensuring low temperature, and preventing hallucination. The project is considered done when the end-to-end flow works, all required files exist, demo shows functionality, code is clean and documented, and there are no runtime errors.\n\nCitations\n====================\n[1] StudyBuddy.pdf, Page 1, Chunk 0\n[2] StudyBuddy.pdf, Page 2, Chunk 1\n[3] StudyBuddy.pdf, Page 3, Chunk 2\n[4] StudyBuddy.pdf, Page 4, Chunk 3\n[5] StudyBuddy.pdf, Page 5, Chunk 4\n[6] StudyBuddy.pdf, Page 6, Chunk 5\n[7] StudyBuddy.pdf, Page 7, Chunk 6
