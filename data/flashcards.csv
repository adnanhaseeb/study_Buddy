What is the main focus of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?,"The main focus of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to organize code into objects, which are instances of classes, and to encapsulate data and behavior together to promote modularity and reusability.","OOPS Important Interview Questions.pdf (Page 2, Chunk 0)",StudyBuddy
How does polymorphism allow objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass?,"Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass by enabling methods to be invoked on objects without knowing their specific types, as long as they adhere to the common interface.","OOPS Important Interview Questions.pdf (Page 3, Chunk 1)",StudyBuddy
What is method overriding?,"Method overriding is the process by which a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The overridden method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters.","OOPS Important Interview Questions.pdf (Page 4, Chunk 2)",StudyBuddy
What is the difference between an interface and a static method in Java?,"An interface is a contract defining methods a class must implement, promoting multiple inheritance, while a static method belongs to the class itself and can be called using the class name for utility functions.","OOPS Important Interview Questions.pdf (Page 5, Chunk 3)",StudyBuddy
What is the purpose of the super keyword in Java?,The super keyword in Java is used to refer to the parent class or superclass. It allows calling methods and constructors from the superclass within a subclass.,"OOPS Important Interview Questions.pdf (Page 6, Chunk 4)",StudyBuddy
What is the difference between method hiding and method overriding in object-oriented programming?,"Method hiding is when a subclass defines a method with the same name as a method in its superclass, creating a new independent method. Method overriding is when a subclass defines a method with the same name as a method in its superclass, but it overrides the superclass method.","OOPS Important Interview Questions.pdf (Page 7, Chunk 5)",StudyBuddy
What is the average salary hike for alumni of AlgoTutor?,The average salary hike for alumni of AlgoTutor is 147%.,"OOPS Important Interview Questions.pdf (Page 8, Chunk 6)",StudyBuddy
How does a deep copy differ from a shallow copy?,"A shallow copy copies the references of objects contained within an object, while a deep copy creates new instances of the objects contained, resulting in a completely independent copy of the original object and its contained objects.","OOPS Important Interview Questions.pdf (Page 9, Chunk 7)",StudyBuddy
"How does the final keyword in Java affect classes, methods, and variables?","The final keyword in Java can be applied to classes, methods, and variables. A final class cannot be subclassed, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final variable cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment.","OOPS Important Interview Questions.pdf (Page 10, Chunk 8)",StudyBuddy
Can a class implement multiple interfaces or inherit from multiple abstract classes?,"A class can implement multiple interfaces, but it can inherit from only one abstract class.","OOPS Important Interview Questions.pdf (Page 11, Chunk 9)",StudyBuddy
